Falcon 9 Landing Prediction
This project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course, where the goal is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. 
This is achieved through classification algorithms based on features such as launch site, payload mass, and orbit type.

Introduction
SpaceX, the private space exploration company, has been trying to make space travel more cost-effective by reusing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket. 
The first stage is designed to land back on Earth after launching its payload into space. 
The objective of this project is to classify whether a Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land or not, based on various features related to the launch.
